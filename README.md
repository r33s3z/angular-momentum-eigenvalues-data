# angular-momentum-eigenvalues-data
Datasets supporting the analysis of eigenvalue statistics and spectral measures in a 2D quantum system with concentric Dirac-delta barriers.

## Description
This repository contains the datasets used to generate the statistical results reported in the associated publication.

The data includes:
- Raw eigenvalue zeros  
- Organized eigenvalue structures  
- Unfolded nearest-neighbor spacings  
- Probability density functions of unfolded level spacings  
- Brody distribution least-squares fits  
- Number variance statistics  
- Shapiro–Wilk normality tests  

All files correspond to the data used in the published manuscript.
